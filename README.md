Predictive Regression Machine Learning on Customer Lifetime Value
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that predicts CLV using the Random Forest Regressor model. The model is trained with a dataset that contains information of A Car Insurance Company

Project Description
This project was created to optimize the ability to identify policy holders who have a low CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) with the goal of reducing

Model Features
The model involves several stages of data preprocessing, including:

Normalization of numerical features using RobustScaler
Categorical feature encoding with OneHotEncoder
Ordinal feature transformation using OrdinalEncoder
Feature engineering to improve model performance
